# After Effects Scripts

Free Adobe After Effects scripts for motion designers. These are small utilities and workflow helpers written in ExtendScript (`.jsx`) with one helper script (`.js`).

If these save you time, check out my paid tools and bundles at `https://sidequesplugins.com`.

## What's Included

- A growing collection of individual `.jsx` scripts (naming prefix `HVDD_`)
- Utility tools for text, layers, keyframes, comp setup, and batch actions
- A couple of "staging" scripts that are experimental or in-progress

## Install

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Copy the `.jsx` scripts you want into your After Effects Scripts folder:
   - macOS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects <version>/Scripts/`
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Scripts\`
3. Restart After Effects.

Tip: You can also keep scripts anywhere and run them via `File > Scripts > Run Script File...`.

## Usage

Most scripts operate on the current selection or the active composition. Open your comp, select layers (if needed), then run the script from `File > Scripts`.
